# Deprecated files
As I went through spring cleaning, I discovered a few files that I couldn't quite remember how they worked. I deleted the files I knew were not useful to the task, but if I wasn't sure about them I moved them here.

Additionally, extra visualization files, plotting files, and saving files were moved here because I believe they are not necessary to reproduce the important parts of the research.


# TODO
Go through these files and either:
1. Remove from deprecated folder and support the file,
    - If you want to move a file out of here, make sure it has test coverage and actually works.
2. Delete the file.
    - Ensure that the results and signifcant research contributions can be reproduced without the file.
